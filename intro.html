					An apple a day keeps the doctor away, delights teachers returning to school Friendswood ISD is partnering with Aramark, their food service provider, to make healthy and nutritious food available for all of its students and teachers. In order to celebrate the new school term, Aramark will give each teacher in the district a back-to-school apple with a message about healthy eating encouraging teachers to reinforce healthy eating by students as well. “We want to give our teachers a back-to-school gift that is healthy and nutritious and that sets an example for our students. We are proud of our students, parents and educators who help Friendswood ISD to improve the health and fitness of the body as well as of the mind,” Food Service Director David Moynihan said. Scientific studies on the health values of eating an apple a day support the truth of the adage. Apples are low in calories and sodium and high in fiber and Vitamin C. In 2012 an Ohio State University study found that eating an apple a day helped significantly lover levels of bad cholesterol in middle-aged adults and in 2011 a Dutch study found that eating apples might help prevent strokes. For food in the school cafeterias at school, Texas Public School Nutrition Policy for Elementary and Intermediate Schools must be followed by Aramark in the school district. The Texas Department of Agriculture has comprised a mandated policy for all Texas schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. The program is geared to maintaining the nutritional integrity of children during the school day. Policies affect all foods being served within a campus during school hours by both school Food Service and food that would be provided by student/parent organizations, vendors and individuals. The dietary guidelines followed by Aramark are based on scientific information from a team of nutrition experts convened by the USDA. The USDA has now replaced the longstanding food pyramid with a new healthy food symbol called My Plate. The guide suggests that half a plate should be made up of fruits and vegetables. Details on this information may be found at: www.choosemyplate.gov “Thank you parents for helping children learn to eat healthy at home. Our food service personnel as well as teachers, administrators and staff are helping them at school to make healthy food choices,” Superintendent Trish Hanks said. “And, thanks to Aramark for planning a winning beginning and giving an apple to our staff.” For more information on food services, visit: www.myfisd.com/services/food-services

                    Katherine Harclerode and Emelie Nelson both 17 and incoming seniors at Friendswood High School have founded the Love Our Lungs Organization. This organization is support for the cure of Cystic Fibrosis. A close friend recently passed away from this disease, which was one of the many reasons they started this group. Their first event is the Ultimate Frisbee tournament where all proceeds go to the CF Foundation. For four hours families with members of all ages can have a great time while helping others. At the event will be food for sale (provided by Which Wich), water for sale, a chance to win a pair of Oakley Sunglasses along with all the sweetheart candies in the jar if you enter the “Guess how many hearts are in the jar,” Silent auction for the “Sweet Basket” filled with Menchies gift cards, Cake Lady gift cards and a beautiful floral arrangement, a jumping castle, tee-shirts for sale, and small games like washers, toss the bean bag and spike ball “This event is also a great way for high schoolers to earn service hours and anyone gets one service hour for bringing a case of water, Harclerode said. A concert performed by Gavin Vriend and his band @ 6p.m. But those who love Frisbees should come for the Ultimate Frisbee team competition. There are already seven teams formed. Some have a dad or two in them along with a few Young Life representatives so age limits are not a qualification. To form YOUR team, contact Katherine Harclerode at 832-444-7980 or Emilie Nelson at 281-900-1918. “Every one of all ages should come out and support a cure for Cystic Fibrosis! Bring money to help donate and your family to have a blast!” Nelson said. Sponsors for the event include Which Wich, DCS Data Solutions LLC, the Harclerode Family, the Nelson Family, Randy K. Ellis, DDS, Tommy and Elaine Ebner, HomeTown Bank, Sonic’s Pete Garcia, Parkwood Vision, Northwest Anesthesia and Pain Services, Raymond James with Sally Branson and Harris B.

The Texas Gulf Coast Chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is thrilled to be associated with the wonderful group, Love our Lungs. This great group of high school students is passionate about raising valuable dollars in the fight against cystic fibrosis and will host a fundraising event,” CF Foundation Executive Director Sissy Boyd said. “We are making tremendous progress toward a cure for all people with cystic fibrosis. Just today, we received the exciting news that a Foundation-supported clinical drug trial showed that participants who took a combination two drug treatment, compared with those on placebo, showed significant and consistent improvement in lung function and in other important health measures. These positive results represent an important milestone in the history of CF—and a significant step forward in our effort to bring new treatments targeting the underlying cause of the disease.” The community of Friendswood is invited to this free event. “We are delighted to have Love our Lungs support our efforts and wish them much success as they help make CF stand for Cure Found!” Boyd said.
